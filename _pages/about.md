Research Field
======
It is worth noting that this personal homepage was developed only to register an account on a certain website, and almost all of the information in it is the content of the original repository of the fork, which don't match mine.

I am an undergraduate student at the National Cyber Security School of Wuhan Universityï¼Œ and I'm interested in artificial intelligence. My main research focuses on security issues in CV and NLP, with some understanding of adversarial examples, backdoor attacks and defense, and model watermarking. Currently, I'm focused on the degeneration of DM.

In fact, I've been conducting this research for less than a year and I'm still inexperienced. If your field of study is similar to mine and you would like to collaborate with me, feel free to contact me via email to discuss further.

As you can see, I didn't fill in all the information on my personal web page, some of the information in the website was pulled from the original repository and didn't match mine. 

Due to some certain unspeakable reason, forced to updated on Sep 24, 2024.
